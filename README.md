# Bees-vs-Turtle

This is my first video game: Turtle vs Bees.
The objective of the game is the turtle must dodge three bees, moving from left to right on the screen, and to hit the golden trophy.
If the turtle hits the golden trophy: he wins the game. If the the turtle hits one of the three bees: he loses the game.
